Ideas:

* Abstract out Builder -> Doc, so we can change implementation
  later. (fromString, fromChar) (this will also let us get rid
  of the orphan instance)

* should write all macros as functions
  Builder -> HeX Builder etc.
  and use command like functions to turn them into reg parsers.
  this makes them recombinable.

* environments:
  \quote{
  blah blah
  }

  the quote command will strip off the initial newline.

* escapes:
  \x for any x is a literal x
  \\ is a literal backslash
  escape NEEDED for {}|\$ and in some contexts []

* Writeup on motivations:

  good things about pandoc:
  - canonical document that can go into many formats
  bad things:
  - no extensibility
  - no macros
  good things about latex;
  - extensibility through macros
  - no limitations
  bad things about latex:
  - ugly language to program in, difficult to write macros

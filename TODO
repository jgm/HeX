Ideas:

* hugs w/ no fanciness:

  runhugs test.txt

  is all you need. put the source is comments!

* Forget ghc!  Use HUGS!
  hugs +l loads ANY file as literate Haskell.

       -Fcmd  Set  preprocessor  filter  for  source  files  to  cmd (unset by
              default).  Instead of reading a source file directly, Hugs  will
              read the standard output of cmd run with the source file name as
              argument.

So, I could have a preprocessor, docproc, that parses the document &
converts it into a Haskell program, and a shell script, docrun,
that calls runhugs +Fdocproc on the document.

docrun -t html mydoc.txt

produces HTML!

* currently we have a problem with stuff like this:
\begin{Verbatim}
> quoted
\end{Verbatim}
since the > line is interpreted as Haskell. We need a convention
for "stop interpreting as literate Haskell after this line."

* environments:
  \quote{
  blah blah
  }

  the quote command will strip off the initial newline.

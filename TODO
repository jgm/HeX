Ideas:

* reorganize modules:
  Text.HeX  -- HeX, state, variables, run, +++, ==>
  Text.HeX.TeX, Text.HeX.Html -- helpers for building
  Text.HeX.Default -- latex like parsers

* math mode
  should store math mode in state.
  then certain commands can be marked ensureMath
  and they will trigger math mode if it isn't already

* add parsers for $..$, $$..$$
  maybe these are just equiv to

* environments:
  \quote{
  blah blah
  }

  the quote command will strip off the initial newline.

* escapes:
  \x for any x is a literal x
  \\ is a literal backslash
  escape NEEDED for {}|\$ and in some contexts []

* Writeup on motivations:

  good things about pandoc:
  - canonical document that can go into many formats
  bad things:
  - no extensibility
  - no macros
  good things about latex;
  - extensibility through macros
  - no limitations
  bad things about latex:
  - ugly language to program in, difficult to write macros

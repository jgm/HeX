_ think through:  we really need different parsers, not just different
  commands, in math mode ; e.g. for '
  maybe in addition to registerCommand and registerEscaper, we need
  registerTokenParser or something like that... perhaps that could replace
  the character escaper.

_ see notes in TExt.Math.Generic
x system for warnings; e.g. warn if a label is redefined.
_ jail for IO?
_ change math mode so it allows a large list of latex commands
_ figure out how to do verbatims
_ figure out how to do environments (do we need them? why not just use
  {} for grouping?)
_ headers, labels, refs
_ math in both formats (mathml?)
_ bibliography w/ citeproc
_ syntactic macros (why not? in many cases going to Haskell is overkill)

  taking input from /dir/my.hex, output to --output file

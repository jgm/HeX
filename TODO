_ rearrange so that Text.HeX.Math depends on Text.HeX, not vv.
  have math parsers export commands, which also registerMathWriter.
  have main one export dollars etc.
  or have something like "command" that takes a parser rather than
  a string, so $$ can be a command?
  make register, registerFor regular functions, not typeclass fns.
x system for warnings; e.g. warn if a label is redefined.
_ jail for IO?
_ change math mode so it allows a large list of latex commands
_ figure out how to do verbatims
_ figure out how to do environments (do we need them? why not just use
  {} for grouping?)
_ headers, labels, refs
_ math in both formats (mathml?)
_ bibliography w/ citeproc
_ syntactic macros (why not? in many cases going to Haskell is overkill)

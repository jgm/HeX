Ideas:

* currently we have a problem with stuff like this:
\begin{Verbatim}
> quoted
\end{Verbatim}
since the > line is interpreted as Haskell. We need a convention
for "stop interpreting as literate Haskell after this line."

* environments:
  \quote{
  blah blah
  }

  the quote command will strip off the initial newline.

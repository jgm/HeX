Ideas:

* need a new system for multiple arguments. see simple.lhs
  for one that doesn't work.

* environments:
  \quote{
  blah blah
  }

  the quote command will strip off the initial newline.

* Writeup on motivations:

  good things about pandoc:
  - canonical document that can go into many formats
  bad things:
  - no extensibility
  - no macros
  good things about latex;
  - extensibility through macros
  - no limitations
  bad things about latex:
  - ugly language to program in, difficult to write macros
